# What is Notes App?
Notes app is an app where you can store all you notes and download them as a .txt file, this started off as a small project.
However the full project uses firebase auth to authenticate the user and uses firestore to store all the users note in a database. You can visit the full project url('https://private-notes.vercel.app', "here").
